# Basic-Python-based-Games
This project stores 5 Basic Python Games..!

## WHY I DID THIS?

Well, with an urge to play, I thought to build something first and play in the process..! and it did work!

## *CONTENTS*
 ## COMPUTER GUESS
 
 Well you will have to help the computer in guessing a number, you have previously stored in your head by giving hints
 like -> its too high/ its too low..
 Tricking the computer this time ;)
 fun..right?
    
 ## MADLIBS
 
 This ones filled with so much fun and humour XD
 You will have to give certain words of your choice as input depending on the description (verb/adjective/noun). The program
 would set them in certain missing locations of a previously build story template. This would complete the story and make 
 it meaningful.Okay maybe not meaningful.. but giving you a ROFL for sure !XD
 Check it out to unleash the fun!
 I have included two story templates--> HARRY POTTER and FRIENDS ....All time favourite of mine and million others..!
   
 ## HIGH-LOW
 
This ones quite the opposite of Computer guess.
This time computer tricks you into guessing a number(given a range) by giving hints like -> too high /too low /little high /
little low till you guess it right..
   
 ## HANGMAN
    
Ah! this ones quite tricky!
you will be given a word to guess with all letters missing!
You have to keep guessing alphabets till you guess the entire word. It does warn you if a certain letter is not a part of the
word or if you entered any illegal character.
But wait thats not all....
You also have LIVES!! equal to the length of the word. You shed a life each time you guess the wrong letter. So, you will have 
to guess the word before you loose all your lives!!
    
 ## RockPaperScissors
 
The age old delight itself!
Well the rules are pretty much the same..(Rock>scissors>paper>rock). You will just enter your choice as r/s/p against a random 
choice of the computer in a BEST OF THREE!
Lets see who winss..!
